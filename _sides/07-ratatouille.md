<!-- Steps -->
1. Peel eggplant and cut lengthwise into slices 3/8" thick, 3 inches long and 1 inch wide. Cut zucchini into slices about same size as eggplant. Place vegetables in a bowl and toss with 1 teaspoon of salt. Let stand 30 minutes. Drain and then dry each slice with a towel.
2. Very lightly brown eggplant and zucchini in olive oil, one layer at time, about one minute on each side. Place on paper towels to drain. In the same pan cook the onions and peppers slowly until tender, about 10 minutes. Do not brown. Stir in garlic and season to taste.
3. Slice tomatoes into 3/8” strips, seed. Lay over the onions and peppers. Cover and cook over low heat for 5 minutes until tomatoes have started to render their juices. Uncover and baste tomatoes with the juices. Raise heat and boil for several minutes until juice has almost evaporated.
4. Use a 21⁄4 quart Dutch oven, about 21⁄4 inches deep. Place 1/3 of tomato mixture in bottom and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of parsley. Arrange half of eggplant and zucchini on top. Layer in another 1/3 of tomato mixture and 1 tablespoon of parsley. Layer in remaining eggplant and zucchini and top with remaining tomatoes and parsley.
5. Cover casserole and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. Uncover, tip casserole and baste with rendered juices. Correct seasoning. Raise heat slightly and cook uncovered for 15 minutes, basting several times, until juices have evaporated leaving only a spoonful or two of olive oil. Be careful of heat so you do not scorch vegetables in bottom of the casserole, Set aside uncovered. Can be served hot or cold. If serving hot, reheat slowly.
