title: Goulash/Goodman Special
anecdote: Other than tacos, this is the most memorable of your mother’s creations. No other dish was served as often and it remains an all-time favorite. This original is Italian. If you want Mexican, use cumin, coriander and chili instead of the Italian spices. Or try Asian versions.
