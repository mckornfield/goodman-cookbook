<!-- Steps -->
1. In a large stock pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, green and red peppers, jalapeño, garlic and carrots. Cook until vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, bouillon, water, lentils and beans. Add stewed tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, bay leaf, oregano, basil, red-pepper flakes, celery salt and coriander.
2. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until lentils are tender, about 45 minutes to an hour. If chili is too watery, simmer uncovered to desired thickness. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
