title: Paella
anecdote: This recipe is a combination of several Paella recipes and you are encouraged to try your own variations. We do suggest that the basics of rice, chicken, saffron and chorizo should always be included. It is the contrast of ingredients that makes this dish so delicious and so “wow” when presented. The lobster is optional since it is mostly for decoration. Pan needed&#58; 14” Paella Pan or very large fry pan.

<!-- Steps -->
Paella is a dish in which all of the ingredients are prepped ahead of time and then added one after the other to the Paella Pan. ft can be partially prepared ahead through step 3.
When you are about 45 minutes away from serving, restart by heating the Paella pan and proceeding with steps 4 through 8. 

1. Shell, devein and brine shrimp for 20 minutes. Scrub clams and mussels. 
2. Combine and crush oregano, pepper, 1/3 of the garlic, salt, vinegar, and two tablespoons of olive oil. Rub chicken with this mixture and refrigerate for 1 hour.
3. Heat remaining olive oil in paella pan and brown chicken over moderate heat. Add ham, chorizo, salt pork, onion, remaining garlic, green pepper, capers, paprika and coriander. Cook 10 minutes over low heat. (At this point that you can stop the preparation by turning off heat and tightly cover the pan with foil. 45 minutes prior to serving, turn on heat and continue as below)
4. Heat white wine and add the saffron to it. Set aside to steep.
5. Add tomato sauce to pan and stir in rice and cook over moderate heat for 5 minutes. Stir in wine and saffron mixture. Add stock, mix well and bring to a simmer.
6. Simmer for 25 minutes. During first 10 minutes stir mixture once or twice. Then add shrimp, sprinkle on peas, spread clams and mussels over top and cover tightly with aluminum foil for last 15 minutes.
7. If using lobster for decoration steam it for 10 minutes before paella is finished. Cut pimentos into long strips about a quarter of an inch wide.
8. For final assembly place pimento strips in a spoke like pattern radiating from center.  Discard any clams or mussels that have not opened. If using, cut lobster tail off and place on one side of pan and the head, upright, on the other side. Serve in paella pan at the table. Each guest should get 1 or 2 pieces of everything and a serving of rice.
