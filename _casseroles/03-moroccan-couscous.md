title: Moroccan Couscous
anecdote: We like this dish so much we are on our second couscousery. Unfortunately you cannot buy prepared lamb stock, so use the recipe below to make your own; itâ€™s easy. You cannot substitute beef stock as it will take away from the lamb flavor. The stock can be made either the day before or the morning of. The Sauce Piquant really adds a special dimension to this dish, but be careful, it is very hot. Pans needed, Couscousery or large lidded stockpot upon which you can place a colander.

Moroccan Couscous (sans above sauces)
<!-- split -->

2 cups | canned chickpeas, drained
4 pounds | cubed leg of lamb
1/2 cup | olive oil
1 teaspoon | salt
1/2 teaspoon | black pepper
1 can | 6 oz. tomato paste
2 cloves | garlic, finely minced
3 quarts | lamb stock (see above)
1 tablespoon | caraway seeds, crushed
1/2 teaspoon | ground cumin seed, or more
2 cups | couscous
1/2 cup | water
6 | turnips, cut into pieces
6 | small white onions
12 | carrots, cut into pieces
1/2 | sm. head cabbage, cut into wedges
1 | green pepper, cut into strips
2 | small zuchini, sliced
3 | hot peppers, seeded & finely diced

<!-- split -->
<!-- Steps -->
1. Place lamb cubes, olive oil, salt, black pepper and tomato paste in a large deep  stockpot. Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat stirring occasionally.
2. Add garlic, stock, caraway seeds, hot peppers, cumin seed and chickpeas. Bring mixture to a boil, cover and simmer for 45 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, spread the couscous on a large platter and sprinkle with water. Mix lightly with fingers grains are moistened. Line top of the steamer or colander with cheesecloth. Drop moistened grains into cheesecloth. Do not pack down.
4. Lower steamer or colander into top of stockpot and cover tightly. Grains will cook in the steam and absorb flavors from lamb. Stir grains once or twice during steaming to break up any lumps.
5. After lamb has simmered for 45 minutes add turnips, onions and carrots. Cook 15 minutes longer. Add zucchini, cabbage and green pepper. Cook for 10 more minutes, until vegetables are tender. Taste sauce and adjust seasoning to taste.
6. Spread couscous on a large, wanned, serving platter. Gradually add the liquid from lamb stew, stirring couscous until it will not absorb any more. Cover with foil and let stand for 7 minutes. Add liquid to couscous until it will not absorb any more.
7. Push grains into a rounded mound in center of platter. Arrange lamb and vegetables in an attractive pattern around the mound. Serve with sauce piquant.
