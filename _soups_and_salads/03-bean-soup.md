<!-- Steps -->

2. If using bacon instead of ham bone; in a fry pan, sauté bacon until done but not crisp. Add bacon to beans. Sauté garlic and diced onion in bacon fat or olive oil until softened. Add tomatoes to mixture and simmer for 30 minutes, breaking up tomatoes.
3. Add tomatoes, onion and garlic mixture to simmering beans. Continue simmering for 2 hours.
4. Add cabbage and green pepper. Simmer additional 30 minutes. Add pasta simmer for an additional 20 minutes. Adjust seasoning and serve. Great with Italian or garlic bread.

Note: If you want to freeze part of the soup to use at a later date; prior to adding cabbage, green pepper and pasta, take half or 3 quarters of the soup, divide into portions convenient for you. Cool and freeze. Thaw, add cabbage, peppers and pasta to soup portions. Soup will last several weeks in freezer.
