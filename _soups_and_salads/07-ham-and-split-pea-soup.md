title: Ham and Split Pea Soup
anecdote: Use a small 2 1/2-pound smoked picnic portion ham if you can find one. Otherwise, buy half a bone-in smoked ham and remove enough meat, which can be frozen and used later for other meals or sandwiches, to leave about 2 1/2-pounds of ham and bone. The finished soup will continue to thicken as it stands but can be thinned with some water when reheated

<!-- Steps -->
1. Bring 3 quarts water, ham, and bay leaves to boil, covered, over medium-high heat in large soup kettle. Reduce heat to low and simmer until meat is tender and pulls away from bone, 2 to 2 1⁄2 hours. Remove ham meat and bone from broth; add split peas and thyme and simmer until peas are tender but not dissolved, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, when ham is cool enough to handle, shred meat into bite-sized pieces, reserve. Discard rini bone and fat.
2. While ham is simmering, heat oil in large skillet over medium high heat until shimmering.  Add onions, carrots, and celery; sauté, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid evaporates and vegetables begin to brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low; add butter, garlic, and sugar. Cook vegetables, stirring frequently, until deeply browned but not burned, 30 to 35 minutes; set aside.
3. Add sautéed vegetables, potatoes, and shredded ham to soup; simmer until potatoes are tender and peas dissolve and thicken soup to the consistency of light cream, about 20 minutes. Season with black pepper and balsamic vinegar. Ladle soup into bowls, sprinkle with red onion and serve.
