<!-- Steps -->
1. Bring skin on potatoes to a boil in salted water and simmer just until tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Time will vary, depending upon size of potatoes. While potatoes are still hot, use a paring knife to peel off their skins. Cut out any blemishes. Slice potatoes in half through their long axis and then across into 1/4‚Äù slices or bite sized pieces.
2. Mix Italian dressing with potatoes while still hot. Be careful not to break up the potato slices while mixing. Place in refrigerator until marinating potatoes have cooled, about two hours.
3. Mix together mayonnaise, mustard, Worcester sauce, and seasoned salt.
4. When potatoes have cooled, carefully mix in olives and pickles and carefully fold in mayonnaise mixture.
5. Continue to chill until ready to serve.
