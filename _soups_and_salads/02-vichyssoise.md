title: Vichyssoise a la Ritz
anecdote: Bar none, this is the best vichyssoise we have ever had at home or in a restaurant. It is from an old Craig Claiborne book, and we have never found any other recipe to equal it. Since Claiborne is gone, we wanted you to have a copy of this great, cold soup classic.
