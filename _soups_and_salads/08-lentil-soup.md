title: Hearty Lentil Soup
anecdote: Lentils du Puy, sometimes called French green lentils, are our first choice for this recipe, but brown, black, or regular green lentils are fine. Cooking times will vary depending on the type of lentils. Carefully sort through lentils to remove small stones and dirt.

<!-- Steps -->
1. Fry bacon in large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fat is rendered and bacon is crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and carrots; cook, stirring occasionally until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf and thyme. Stir in lentils, salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook on medium low until vegetables are softened and lentils have darkened, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir occasionally. Uncover, increase heat to high, add wine, chicken broth and water; bring to boil, cover partially, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until lentils are tender but still hold their shape, 30 to 35 minutes. Discard bay leaf.
2. Puree 3 cups of soup in blender until smooth, return to pot; stir in vinegar and heat soup over medium-low until hot, about 5 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons parsley and serve, garnishing each bowl with some of the remaining parsley.
