title: Gazpacho
anecdote: Over the years we have tried a lot of different Gazpacho recipes because it is a great cold soup for summer and the perfect accompaniment to Paella. This recipe has become our favorite. It is important to use very good sherry vinegar and tomato juice.

<!-- Steps -->
1. Place cubed tomatoes and their juices in a large bowl.
2. Cut peppers into rough 1” pieces and process carefully in a Cuisinart until they are broken down into 1⁄4” pieces. This will take about 8 to 10 one second pulses. Larger pieces should be removed and hand chopped. Do not liquefy. Mix with the cubed tomatoes.
3. Cut cucumbers into 1” pieces and process the same way as the peppers and add to the tomatoes and peppers.
4. Mix in the onion, shallot, garlic, vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Let stand until vegetables begin to release their juices, about 15 minutes.
5. Stir in tomato juice and water. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate to blend flavors, at least 4 hours.
6. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper and serve cold. Can be garnished at serving with garlic croutons and a dash of olive oil.
