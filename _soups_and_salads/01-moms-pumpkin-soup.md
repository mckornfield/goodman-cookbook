title: Mom's Pumpkin Soup
anecdote: I am sure you all remember this soup from Drew and Kelly’s groom’s dinner. Your mother asked the chef at Pascal’s to make her recipe for the dinner. After the dinner the chef asked her how she liked her pumpkin soup. Your mother answered, “It was a good pumpkin soup but not mine.” Here’s hers.

<!-- Steps -->
1. Melt butter in pan; add onion and saute until limp. Do not brown. Sprinkle with curry powder and sauté for another minute
2. Put onions, pumpkin and salt into Cuisinart and process until well blended. (Can be set aside at this point, but process again before continuing.)
3. Pour in cream while processing. Be careful not to whip cream. Transfer mixture to saucepan, stir in chicken stock and heat slowly so as not to curdle mixture.
4. Serve hot. Can be garnished with a dollop of sour cream.
