title: Standing Rib Roast, Slow Roasted
anecdote: We got this method from Drew. Every time we have used it, it has produced a roast that is perfectly cooked to medium rare, has retained all of its juices and looks great. You can cook other roasts using this method as well. You must use a cooking thermometer to make sure the roast is at the proper finished temperature, 140°. I guess all those cooking lessons for Drew were not wasted.

<!-- Ingredients -->

5 to 7 pound | standing rib roast
3-10 tablespoons | vegetable oil
1/2 cup | red wine
2 cups | beef broth
2 tablespoons | flour
to taste | salt and pepper

<!-- split -->
<!-- Steps -->
* Preheat oven to 225°.
* Trim a 5 to 7 pound standing rib roast of fat, including most of fat cap.
* Brown on all surfaces on top of the stove in vegetable oil, 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Turn roast carefully so as not to splatter hot oil.
* After roast is browned, place on a rack in a roasting pan, rib side down, and put in oven. Roast for 4 to 5 hours depending upon the size of the roast.
* Use a cooking thermometer (starting at 3 hours) to determine when roast is done. Medium rare is 140°.
* Remove roast from oven and let it stand, covered with foil, for 10 to 15 minutes prior to carving. 

Since a roast cooked this way produces little or no juices during the roasting process, if you want gravy you will have to make it separately.

* Use some pre-roasted roast trimmings. Render them in the pot in which you originally browned the roast.
* Use a little vegetable oil to start the process. Deglaze with Y2 cup red ~vine.
* Add two cups of beef broth and simmer to reduce by half.
* Mix two tablespoon of flour with two tablespoons of water and stir into gravy. Continue to simmer until slightly thickened.
* Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and serve in a heated gravy boat
