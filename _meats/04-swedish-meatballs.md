Note: Because of stricter food handling laws most butchers cannot mix meats in their grinders. At home, you can either use a counter or machine meat grinder. If using a food processor be careful not to mince meat: using already ground meat mixture it will only take 4 or 5, 1-2 second pulses to get the meat to a proper texture and mixture.
