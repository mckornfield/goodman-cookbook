title: Grilled Rare Tuna
serving_info: 3 to 4 servings
anecdote: If you like tuna that is grilled crisp on the outside and rare inside, this is an excellent and easy way to do it. This can also be done on the BBQ but it must be very hot or the tuna will not cook properly.

<!-- Ingredients -->

1 lb. | thick tuna loin, cut into 2 pieces
1/4 cup | dark soy sauce
1/8 cup | dry, wasabi powder
1/3 cup+ | sesame seeds
1/4 cup | honey
2 tablespoons | peanut oil

<!-- split -->
<!-- Steps -->

1. Mix soy, honey and wasabi powder together in a non-reactive bowl, Reserve 1/8 cup for dipping sauce
2. Roll and marinade the tuna steaks in the sauce for one to three hours in refrigerator.  It is best to use a small a dish or plastic bag so that the marinade covers fish steaks continuously. Remove tuna from marinade and discard marinade.
3. On a plate, lay out sesame seeds and roll tuna steaks in the seeds to coat evenly.
4. Heat grill pan or heavy frying pan over high heat for 4 to 5 minutes. Add oil and as soon as oil starts to smoke, place fish in the pan.
5. Grill fish for 1 to 1 1‚ÅÑ2 minutes on each of 4 sides. Cooking time will vary depending upon thickness of steaks and how rare you want them. Tuna cooks very fast, and a minute or two too long can turn it dry and tough.
6. Remove steaks to a rack and cover with foil. Let rest three minutes. Slice thinly and serve with reserved dipping sauce.
