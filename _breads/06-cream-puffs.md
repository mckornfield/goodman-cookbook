4 | eggs
to taste | pinch of salt or pinch of sugar

<!-- Steps -->
1. Preheat oven to 425Â°.
2. Add butter to water in saucepan and bring to a boil. Add flour all at once stirring over low heat until it forms a ball and makes a thin film in the bottom of the pan. Set aside to cool slightly.
3. Beat in eggs, one at a time. It is essential that each egg be thoroughly beaten in before adding the next one.
4. At this point, depending upon whether you will use the puffs for a savory or sweet filling, you beat in either a pinch of salt or a pinch of sugar.
5. Drop portions of batter onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. The size of each dollop will vary depending upon the desired size of the puff.
6. Put in oven for 15 minutes, then lower heat to 300 arid cook for another 15 to 20 minutes, until slightly golden brown.
7. When cooled cut off top one-third. Remove any uncooked dough from inside.
8. Fill puffs to overflowing with filling and cap with puff top.
