<br><br>
<b>Indirect Heat Grill Method</b>
<br><br>
<b>Gas BBQ:</b> shut off center burner and use two outside burners. Place the chicken in center over off burner, between two on burners. If grill only has two burners, shut one off and place chicken above it. If your BBQ has a thermometer that measures the temperature inside the dome, it should be about 250° during cooking process. 
<br><br>
<b>Charcoal BBQ:</b> after coals are covered with white ash, divide in half and push them to top and bottom into two elongated piles leaving an area between them with no coals. Place the chicken on the grill between two piles of coals. 
<br><br>
<b>Broiler:</b> put chicken on a broiler pan at least 10-12 inches below the broiler. Here cooking time is 20 minutes on first side and 10 to 15 minutes on the other and 10 minutes for final glazing.
