<!-- Steps -->
1. Bring chicken broth to a boil and use it to cook the vermicelli; about 9 minutes. This may seem like a small amount of liquid, but just keep stirring. Set aside and keep warm.
2. Melt butter, add flour and cook, stirring for 3 to 4 minutes. Add seasonings.
3. Add remaining ingredients, chicken/turkey last, one at a time, except Parmesan cheese, blending each one well as it is added. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until mixture simmers for about 5 minutes. Stir in vermicelli and place mixture into a large baking dish. Sprinkle cheese on top.
4. Bake at 340Â° for 30 to 45 minutes until golden brown and bubbling hot.
