<!-- Ingredients -->

4 pounds | chicken thighs, bone-in, skin-on
to taste | salt and pepper
4 teaspoons | vegetable oil
4 | carrots, sliced 1/4" thick
2 ribs | celery, sliced 1/4" thick
1 | large onion, minced
6 tablespoons | unbleached flour
1/4 cup | dry sherry
4 1/2 cups | low sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup | whole milk
1 teaspoon | minced fresh thyme leaves
2 | bay leaves
1 cup | frozen peas
3 tablespoons | minced fresh parsley

<!-- split -->
1. Pat chicken dry, season with salt and pepper. Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until just smoking. Add half of chicken and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. Pour off chicken fat and reserve. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken.
2. Add butter to Dutch oven and melt at medium high heat. Add carrots, celery, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Cook until softened about 7 minutes. Stir in flour. Whisk in sherry, scraping up brown bits. Stir in the broth, milk, thyme and bay leaves. Nestle chicken, with any accumulated juices, into pot. Cover and simmer until chicken is fully cooked and tender, about 45 minutes or 160°.
3. Transfer chicken to a cutting board. Discard bay leaves. Allow sauce to settle for a few minutes; skim fat from the surface using a wide spoon. Shred chicken, discarding bones and skin and return to stew.
4. Return stew to a simmer, stir in peas and parsley, season to taste. Drop golf-ball sized dumplings (see recipe below) over top of the stew, about 1⁄4” apart. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until dumplings double in size, 15 to 18 minutes. Serve.
