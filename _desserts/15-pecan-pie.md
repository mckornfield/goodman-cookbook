<!-- Steps -->
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°. Lightly dust a clean work surface with flour and roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Fit circle into a 9-inch pie plate being careful not to stretch dough too thin; create edges of choice. Transfer to freezer until firm, about 15 minutes.
2. Coarsely chop 1 1/4 cups pecans; set aside. In a medium bowl, mix eggs and sugar, and whisk to combine. Add corn syrups and vanilla. Whisk until well combined. Add chopped pecans, and stir. Pour into prepared pie shell.
3. Arrange remaining 1 1/4 cups pecan halves in concentric circles, from outside to center, decoratively on top of pie. Bake until crust is golden, filling is firm, and a cake tester inserted in center of pie comes out clean; 50 to 55 minutes. Cool completely before slicing. Serve with whipped cream.
