title: Easter Basket Dessert / Meringue Shells
anecdote: This is a deceptively easy but impressive Easter dessert. Make meringue shells and let them cool. From 1 pint of strawberry, chocolate and pistachio ice creams, make 5 balls of each flavor using a small ice cream scoop.

<!-- Ingredients -->

3 | egg whites
1 teaspoon | vanilla
1/4 teaspoon | cream of tartar
a dash | salt
1 cup | salt

<!-- split -->
<!-- Steps -->
1. Beat together egg whites, vanilla, cream of tartar and salt until frothy. Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff and sugar dissolves.
2. Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper. 5 shells can be made by using a spoon to spread meringue out to be 4" in diameter and 3/4" thick. Contour shells so that rims are 1/2" wide and centers are scooped out. They should look like little shallow nests. Shells can also be made using a pastry bag with a No. 7 star tube. Bake at 275Â° for one hour.
3. Fill each meringue shell with 1 ball of each ice cream flavor. For at opping use frozen strawberries that have thawed but still have a few ice crystals remaining.
