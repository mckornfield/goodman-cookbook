<!-- Ingredients -->

2 sticks | butter
1 cup | sugar
1 | egg
1 teaspoon | almond extract
2 cups | flour

<!-- split -->
<!-- Steps -->
1. Preheat oven to 350°.
2. Cream together butter and sugar.
3. Add egg and almond extract, mix well. Add flour, mix well.
4. Work dough thoroughly and chill for easier handling. Press small amount of dough into Sandbakkel tins as thinly as possible.
5. Place tins on cookie sheet, dough side up. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until slightly browned. Allow tins to cool. To remove cookies from tins, hold upside down and gently squeeze the sides of the tin. Sometimes it is necessary to gently rap the corner of the tin on a hard surface to dislodge the cookie.
