Financial, political, grocery clerk<br>
Enrolled in a program, launched your career<br>
Many, many hours you’d have to work<br>
Put aside any failures and fear

First husband arrived, two children followed<br>
A child’s illness tested your mettle<br>
But you didn’t stay beaten or hollowed<br>
Instead, triumph; your life in fine fettle<br>


Another husband, and two children more<br>
Two fiery girls following two boisterous boys<br>
A fine yellow house, with many a door<br>
And the four children to share many joys<br>

And yes, we four kids have brought love and pain<br>
But we know you’d do it all over again

_PS: try refreshing_
