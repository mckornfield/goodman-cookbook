<!-- Steps -->
1. Preheat oven to 350°
2. Brown 2 tablespoons of onion and all the ground beef in a little vegetable oil. Add chili, salt, pepper and pepper flakes. Simmer covered for 10 minutes. Remove excess fat.
3. Just prior to filling, brush both sides of the tortillas with melted butter. In center of each tortilla place 1 tablespoon of chili mixture, 1 teaspoon onion and 1 teaspoon grated cheese.
4. Roll up tortillas and place them in two rows in a 13x 9 1/2 x2” baking dish. Spoon remaining chili mixture over rolled tortillas. Make sure to cover each tortilla with mixture to keep them soft.
5. Sprinkle remaining chopped onion and grated cheese over top of the tortillas. Bake uncovered for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
