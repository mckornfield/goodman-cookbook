<!-- Steps -->
1. Remove husks from corn and reserve. Cut enough kernels from corn ears to make 8 cups and combine with 11⁄4 cups corn meal in a processor. Grind until chunky.
2. In an electric mixer beat butter and shortening until creamy. Mix in sugar, half and half, and salt. Add corn puree and remaining 11⁄4 cups corn meal, mix to combine.
3. Overlap 2 corn husks on a work surface and spread 1⁄4 cup corn mixture down center of husks, forming a 2x4” rectangle. Place 1 cheese strip and 2 chili strips in center of filling. Spread 1⁄4 cup corn mixture over chili and cheese, covering completely. Fold 2 long sides of husks over filling, fold in ends. Tie with string and repeat for remaining husks.
4. Stand tamales in steamer rack. Place over boiling water. Cover and steam until tamales are firm to touch, about 50 minutes.
5. Tamales can be refrigerated and then re-steamed until hot, about 20 minutes.
