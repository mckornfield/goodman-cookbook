<!-- Ingredients -->

1 lb. | ground beef
2 cans | chili with beans
1/2 head | lettuce, shredded
1 dozen | corn tortillas
8 oz. | aged cheddar cheese, shredded

<!-- split -->
<!-- Steps -->
1. Brown the meat and add the chili with beans. Bring to a simmer.
2. Using a little vegetable oil in a small frying pan, slightly brown and soften tortillas on both sides. Fold in half and place on paper towels to drain. Serve on plate.
3. Mix lettuce and tomatoes in a bowl. Place cheese in a separate bowl.
4. Put everything on table and let everyone build their own tacos. Our preference is to start by putting meat and bean mixture into the taco, add taco sauce, cheese, lettuce and tomato in that order.
