<!-- Steps -->
* Buy frozen puff pastry sheets. Roll out one sheet until thin.
* Brush egg wash (one egg and two tablespoons of water beaten together) on top of sheet.
* Sprinkle any seasonings you want on one-half of sheet, i.e. Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, cayenne pepper, etc.
* Fold over and roll again to seal. Cut into ½ inch strips using a pastry cutter.
* Hold ends and twist each straw two to three times and then press each end down onto a cookie sheet so that they stick.
* Bake at 425° for 8 to 10 minutes, or until slightly browned.
