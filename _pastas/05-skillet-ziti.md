<!-- Steps -->

1. Starting at narrow end of chicken breast, slice into 1⁄4” slices and each slice into 1” lengths. Season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over inedimn-high heat untiljust smoking. Add chicken in a single layer and cook for 1 minute without stirring. Stir chicken and continue to cook until most, but not all of the pink color has disappeared and chicken is lightly browned around edges, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a clean bowl and set aside.
2. Add remaining tablespoon of oil, onion, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt to skillet. Return skillet to medium-high heat and cook, stirring often, until onion is softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Add ziti, 2 cups of water, and broth. Bring to a boil over high heat and simmer until tirring every few minutes
4. Add broccoli, sun-dried tomatoes and remaining 3/4 cup water. Cover, reduce heat to  medium and cook until broccoli turns bright green and is almost tender, 3 to 5 minutes. 5. Uncover and return heat to high. Stir in cream, Asiago, and reserved chicken with any accumulated juices and continue to simmer, uncovered, until sauce is thickened and chicken is cooked and heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve, passing more grated Asiago at table.
